%% Buckling
% ME466 - Project 1 - Group 27 
%(Daniel Howard, Nick Hassler, Josiah Chan, Richard Estey)

%% Assumptions
% Length of the rod is the exposed length while the bed is
% tipped. Effective length is calculated using AISC recomendations  

% The rod is a 'Johnson column" based on the calculations of the
% slenderness ratio for multiple diameters

% The rod will fail due to buckling before it will fail due to compressive
% stress

% Boundary conditions: Fixed-pinned
% because top of the shaft must be able to rotate to lift the bed, and the
% bottom of the shaft is trapped by the pressure vessel in two directions,
% and the load will always be compression (locking the third direction as
% well)

% 

%% Constants 

F = 7.3738e+04; % from force balance
l = 1.03; % length of exposed column (m)
E = 200E9; % average modulus for carbon steel (Pa)

%% Vectors for calculations

d = .00635:0.00635:0.0508;% radius of column vector (m)
r = d./2; % radius vector
A = pi*r.^2; % cross sectional area (m^2)
I = pi*r.^4; % second moment of area (m^4)

for i = 1:8
    k(i) = sqrt(I(i)/A(i)); %radius of gyration
end

% list of material properties from table A9. 
% Order is: Hot rolled 1010,1020,1030,1040- Cold rolled 1010,1020,1030,1040
% We chose these steels because they are common and relatively inexpensive

%% Calculating effective length and Slenderness ratio for critical loads

leff = 0.8*l; % effective length based on AISC recommendation
Sr_cl = leff./k; % Slenderness ratio for critical loads 

%% Calculating and Plotting Critical Loads (Johnson equation)

for i=1:8
    Pcr(i) = (Syc(i)-(1/E)*((Syc(i)*Sr_cl(i))/(2*pi))^2)*A(i) % Johnson equation 4.43
