Sr = l./k; %slenderness ratio

%% Boundary conditions: Fixed-pinned

% because top of the shaft must be able to rotate to lift the bed, and the
% bottom of the shaft is trapped by the pressure vessel in two directions,
% and the load will always be compression.

leff = 0.8*l; %effective length based on AISC recommendation
Sr_cl = leff./k; % Slenderness ratio for critical loads 
Sr_cl = Sr_cl.'; % flip to row vector


%% Once material is chosen, plot Pcr/A curve Euler/Johnson
% I dont have access to the COLMPLOT function that apparently comes with
% the book.  I think it would be useful to have the Euler Johnson curve in
% our report (pg 198 in Machine design 4th Ed). Our column is in the
% Johnson region

E = 200E9; % average modulus for carbon steel (Pa)

Syc = (pi^2)*E./(Sr_cl.^2); % Compressive yield strength (Pa)
SrD = pi*sqrt(2*E./Syc); % mid point of Euler-Johnson curve

% critical load from force balance is F, Pcr is plotted curve of critical
% loads by area vector
Pcr = ((pi^2)*E.*A)./Sr_cl.^2;

%from the plot above, we see that the critical load and the radius
%intersect at about 0.016 meters.

%% Using the radius found above

r_true = 0.016; % (m)
d_true = r_true*2/.0254; % (in)
A_true = pi*r_true^2; % (m^2)
I_true = pi*r_true^4; % second moment of area (m^4)
k_true = sqrt(I/A); % radius of gyration (m)


Sr_true = leff/k_true; %actual slenderness ratio
Syc_true = (pi^2)*E/(Sr_true^2); %137 MPa

stress_true = F/A_true; % 91.7 MPA

FoS = Syc_true/stress_true % Fos =~ 1.5
